# Using Conda within ENTRYPOINT was taken from:
# https://pythonspeed.com/articles/activate-conda-dockerfile/
#
# This Dockerfile uses a base image that already contains the Conda and Pip
# requirements, copies updated versions of variable subsetter source code
# (which is much quicker than creating the Python environment), and runs all
# tests.

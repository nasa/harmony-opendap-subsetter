#
# Using Conda within ENTRYPOINT was taken from:
# https://pythonspeed.com/articles/activate-conda-dockerfile/
#
# This Dockerfile will create a base image containing all the Conda and Pip
# requirements for the variable subsetter.
#
# This Dockerfile does not copy the pymods or the test directory, these will
# be copied when the image is run as a container, to allow more rapid
# development iteration.

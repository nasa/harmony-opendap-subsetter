    "# Harmony OPeNDAP SubSetter (HOSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Slack:** #variable_subsetter\n",
    "* **Jira:** [SDPS Data Services](https://bugs.earthdata.nasa.gov/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=757&view=planning.nodetail)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is HOSS?\n",
    "\n",
    "HOSS is the [Harmony OPeNDAP SubSetter](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-opendap-subsetter); a Harmony backend service that translates a request specified by the user into an [OPeNDAP-compatible constraint expression](https://opendap.github.io/documentation/UserGuideComprehensive.html#Constraint_Expressions), to retrieve only the data requested by the user. HOSS is written in Python, and exists within a Docker image, hosted in [the GitHub container registry](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-opendap-subsetter/pkgs/container/harmony-opendap-subsetter).\n",
    "\n",
    "HOSS heavily relies on a combination of CF-Convention metadata, and the [earthdata-varinfo package](https://github.com/nasa/earthdata-varinfo) to retrieve the variables a user requests, as well as additional variables contained in the CF-Convention references and variable dimension scales of those requested variables. This ensures that the end-user receives a viable output product, where the returned pixels retain spatial and temporal location information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable subset (what you need, in addition to what you ask for)\n",
    "* Bounding box spatial subset.\n",
    "* Spatial subsetting for a GeoJSON shape file.\n",
    "* Temporal subset (single range).\n",
    "* Named-dimension subsetting.\n",
    "* Preservation of input granule hierarchy.\n",
    "* NetCDF-4 output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* L3 or L4 data, with CF-Convention compliant metadata for grid dimensions.\n",
    "* Data accessible via Hyrax.\n",
    "* Hierarchical granules have `.dmrpp` files with `<Group>` elements.\n",
    "* UMM-Var records associated with the collection.\n",
    "* An OPeNDAP UMM-S record, associated with the UMM-C record(s) for your collection(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How HOSS processes a request\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/HOSS_sequence_diagram.png\" width=\"600px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "For all requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HOSS receives a Harmony message, which can specify requested variables and/or a bounding box spatial extent. HOSS also receives a STAC catalog entry containing the OPeNDAP URL for the granule.\n",
    "* HOSS extracts the relevant information from the message and STAC catalog entry.\n",
    "* HOSS makes a request to Hyrax for the Dataset Metadata Response (DMR) file associated with the granule.\n",
    "* HOSS parses the DMR file using `earthdata-varinfo`, creating a mapping of variable dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For variable subset requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HOSS extracts all required variables to support those requested using the `earthdata-varinfo` mapping. For example, spatially gridded variables will require their grid dimension variables, such as latitude, longitude and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For spatial, temporal or named-dimension subset requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HOSS performs a prefetch of grid dimension variables, in full, from Hyrax.\n",
    "* HOSS translates the dimension extents as defined in the Harmony request into dimension array indices. For example, a bounding box with -60 ≤ latitude (degrees north) ≤ -40 will be found to correspond to the $M^{\\rm{th}}$ and $N^{\\rm{th}}$ index in the `latitude` dimension array.\n",
    "* HOSS appends array index ranges to all gridded variables to be retrieved from Hyrax. For example: `latitude[M:N]`, `longitude[X:Y]` and `science_variable[][M:N][X:Y]`. In this example, `science_variable` has grid dimensions `time`, `latitude` and `longitude`, in that order. However, HOSS does not rely on variable dimensions to be in a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for all requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HOSS creates a DAP4 constraint expression for the final variable and/or bounding box spatial subset.\n",
    "* HOSS makes a request for the final NetCDF-4 output. (Note - if a bounding box is requested, and it crosses the grid edge, filling will be applied before the results are staged)\n",
    "* HOSS stages the results using standard Harmony functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a GeoJSON shape file is included in a request, or a bounding box is specified for projection-gridded data, HOSS is combined with the MaskFill Harmony backend service to create a polygon spatial subset. In both cases, HOSS identifies the spatial dimension indices that define a minimally encompassing bounding box for the shape, and requests this from OPeNDAP. MaskFill is then used to fill those pixels that are within this bounding box, but outside of the polygon. Note, a geographically defined bounding box will not be rectangular for some non-geographic projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples will use [harmony-py](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-py) to make requests to Harmony. `harmony-py` is distributed via the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/harmony-py/)), and can be installed to your current Python environment via Pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install harmony-py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial set-up\n",

# These requirements are used by the documentation Jupyter notebooks in the
# harmony-opendap-subsetter/docs directory.
#
# First create a conda or pyenv environment. To create a conda environment:
#
# conda create --name hoss-documentation python=3.11 --channel conda-forge -y
# conda activate hoss-documentation
#
# Then to install the dependencies:
#
# pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
#
# You should then be able to start a Jupyter notebook server and run both of
# the DAAC operator and end-user notebooks.
